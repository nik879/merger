My focus lies in driving sales and marketing strategies while fostering collaboration with customers and energy providers to tackle the key challenges of the renewable energy landscape.  Before joining neoom, I spent over two decades at Fronius International, where I honed my skills in new business development within the renewable energy sector and played a pivotal role in shaping the strategic direction of the Solar Energy Business Unit. My journey at Fronius was marked by dynamic leadership, the successful building of high-performing teams, and a deep commitment to advancing sustainability.  During my tenure at Fronius, I embarked on an exciting venture as Managing Director of Fronius Mexico. There, I established a new branch from scratch, capturing key accounts and driving significant growth. Prior to that, I was instrumental in building a sales network across Latin America and managing major key accounts in the automotive sector. These diverse experiences have equipped me with deep insights into developing robust sales structures and fostering rich intercultural understanding.  As a board member of Bundesverband Photovoltaic Austria, I actively collaborate with industry leaders to push the boundaries of solar power initiatives and advocate for sustainable energy policies.

Ein hochoptimiertes Druck-Ventil-System mit Argon-Gas ermöglicht es, Reagenzien mit höchster Präzision und Effizienz durch das Mikrofluiden-Chip-System zu pumpen. Diese Präzision reduziert den Reagenzienverbrauch auf ein Minimum. Herkömmliche säulenbasierte Synthesizer benötigen im Vergleich bis zu 100-mal mehr Reagenzien. Mit den Kilobaser Reagenzienkartuschen für DNA-Oligos, DNA-Sonden und den entsprechenden Mikrofluiden-Chips können personalisierte DNA-Produkte in 3 einfachen Schritten hergestellt werden. Die gebrauchsfertigen Kartuschen enthalten alle Reagenzien, die zur Synthese von DNA-Oligos und DNA-Sonden benötigt werden. Aufgrund der sicheren Herstellung der Kartuschen besteht kein Risiko, mit gefährlichen Substanzen in Kontakt zu kommen.  Die mikrofluiden Chips enthalten eine Mikrosäule aus Controllled Pore Glass (CPG), in der die Synthese beginnt. CPG ermöglicht auch die Verankerung von DNA-Modifikationen, auf denen das DNA-Produkt wachsen kann. Durch die Kombination unserer verschiedenen DNA-Modifikationsprodukte können eine Vielzahl von Werkzeugen für die Molekularbiologie hergestellt werden. Das komplexe Zusammenspiel von optimiertem Druck und Reagenzienvolumen ermöglicht die Synthese von gebrauchsfertigen DNA-Oligos und DNA-Sonden in weniger als 2 Stunden.  Die einfache Bedienung und das kompakte Design des Geräts machen den Kilobaser zu einer willkommenen Unterstützung in jeder Laborroutine.
